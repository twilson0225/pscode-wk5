// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Prompt the user to enter a number.
Convert the input to an integer.
Use the modulo operator to check if the number is divisible by 2.
If the remainder is 0, print that the number is even.
If the remainder is not 0, print that the number is odd.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Prompt user to enter the first number and store it in num1
Prompt user to enter the second number and store it in num2
Prompt user to enter the third number and store it in num3
Prompt user to enter the fourth number and store it in num4
Prompt user to enter the fifth number and store it in num5

Store all the numbers in a list called numbers

Calculate the sum of all numbers in the list
Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 5

Initialize min_number to the first number in the list
Initialize max_number to the first number in the list

For each number in the list:
If the number is less than min_number, update min_number
If the number is greater than max_number, update max_number

Print the average with a message
Print the smallest number with a message
Print the largest number with a message
